     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
     Message from routine setup:
     using ibrav=0 with symmetry is DISCOURAGED, use correct ibrav instead

     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      32
     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
